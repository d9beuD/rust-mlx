# Gates: Rust MLX inference engine

OWNS: src/**, tests/**, kernels/**, scripts/**, docs/**, results/**, Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, AGENTS.md, README.md

Scope: native Rust inference, verified against an independent MLX oracle, measured optimizations on the requested checkpoint.

- [x] G1: pinned dependencies and studied upstream sources documented
  EVIDENCE: docs/prior-art.md, docs/upstream-lock.json, Cargo.lock
- [x] G2: Rust formatting, strict Clippy and release tests pass
  CHECK: scripts/check.sh
  EXPECT: QUALITY_CHECKS_PASSED
  EVIDENCE: results/quality-current.json; format, strict workspace/all-target/all-feature Clippy,16 release tests pass; code SHA verifies no subsequent core change
- [x] G3: numerical kernel tests pass against native MLX
  EVIDENCE: tests/native_kernels.rs; real BF16 GDN output/state and QSA prefill match the independent oracle exactly
- [x] G4: dense model autoregressive trajectory matches MLX oracle
  EVIDENCE: dense parity: max error 0, 32/32 tokens; hybrid fixture max error 0, 24/24 tokens
- [x] G5: requested Qwen4Exp checkpoint generates correctly with its quantization and cache
  EVIDENCE: results/target-oracle-mlx32.2.json; target parity max error 0, 16/16 tokens
- [x] G6: raw repeated baseline and candidate performance reports saved with environment metadata
  EVIDENCE: results/target-baseline-256.json, target-ab-ple-256.json, target-ab-async-256.json, microbench.json; fresh KV, warmup, alternating candidates
- [x] G7: optimized path improves a measured workload and preserves a reference fallback
  EVIDENCE: target-mtp-depth3-256.json, target-mtp-depth-sweep-256.json; exact native Metal reference with MTP improves the raw 256-token workload, plain reference remains available
- [x] G8: MTP accept/reject and cache rollback are verified
  EVIDENCE: verify-parity.json, rollback-parity.json, target-workloads-chat-256.json; exact logits/cache commit across accepted lengths0–4 and depth1–7 trajectories
- [x] G9: usable CLI, streaming server, benchmarks and known limitations documented
  EVIDENCE: README.md, docs/performance.md, results/server-qualification.json; default binaries, FIFO/batch/prefix/SSE/Unicode/real cancellation; reproducible raw reports and native fallbacks
- [x] G10: 100 tokens per second aspiration evaluated honestly on the requested model
  EVIDENCE: final-raw-plain-mtp-256.json median46.38 plain/70.37 MTP; batch-ab-gemv-hc-qmv-target-256.json GEMV-off median106.55 aggregate B8,13.32 per conversation;100 single-conversation not reached
- [x] G11: exact prefix reuse preserves repeated plain/MTP continuations and bounded eviction
  EVIDENCE: results/prefix-parity-target.json, results/prefix-parity-long.json; complete prompt keys, model-scoped LRU, disabled/oversize/clear/access order checked
- [x] G12: optional continuous plain batching passes real concurrent HTTP trajectories and cancellation
  EVIDENCE: results/server-batch-smoke.json; three8-client mixed-length/SSE series; cancellation during three surviving clients, all128-token outputs exact; Unicode EOF exact in server-utf8-batch8.json; default MTP remains FIFO
- [x] G13: available competitor comparisons use matching trajectories and label incompatibilities
  EVIDENCE: native-target-baseline-256.json all256 IDs exact; mtplx-adapted-baseline/norm-f32.json and omlx-adapted-default/baseline.json reject logit drift before timing; adapter/stock serving limits explicitly labeled
- [x] G14: instrumented Metal validation passes outside performance measurements
  CHECK: scripts/validate-metal.sh
  EXPECT: METAL_VALIDATION_PASSED
  EVIDENCE: results/metal-validation.json,15 passing instrumented kernel tests and actual validation marker; component capture is results/head-component.json and ignored GPU trace
